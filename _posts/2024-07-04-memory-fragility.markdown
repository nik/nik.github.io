I've recently picked up a book called "There Is No Antimemetics Division" which
was recommended by someone random on Twitter and I think I've suffered my first
idea induced panic attack in a coffee shop where I had to put the book down, and ask
my wife to leave and go for a walk. My heart rate went up as existential thoughts and dread,
and not in a cute "society is collapsing around us we're all in this misery together
hee hee" kind of way.

There is this interesting theory that I think originated on the internet, called
Roko's Basilisk. It surmises that there exists an advanced AI that creates a
world where the things inside of it are to contribute to the existence of
this AI, but without knowingly doing so. The mere *knowledge* about this AI is
enough for you to become vulnerable to it and become instantly killed by being
"forced to think thoughts the human mind is incapable of thinking."

"There is no Antimemetics Division" really goes deeper on this concept and, well
it's a whole story around these manifestations, things, creatures, whatever you
want to call them which are "antimemetic," in that, they are present everywhere
but the properties they contain allow them to be cloaked. The cloaking
mechanism, however, isn't one where vision is directly impacted but rather your
memory. You actually see these things, but your memory of their existence is
wiped instanteously. Now, there is more to this, but that's the gist of it. One
of these beings, called SCP-3125 is a being that is purported to live in the 5th
dimension that is slowly making its presence in ours. It happens in the
background while everyone goes on with their lives and the mere knowledge of it
makes you directly visible to it and thus instanteously kill you by eating all
of your memories of everything you know including bodily functions such as
movement resulting in paralysis, initially, until you suffer from a heart attack
and ultimately leading to death.

I put my book down half way and looked around the coffee shop and felt an
immense sense of dread, almost as if the thing I was reading was exposing me to
an existence of something, specifically something that is intelligent enough to
spread itself through ideations, whether it be written word or a screen. Like effective viruses that we
all know and love, the best ones aren't the ones that instantly kill the host
but rather take a longer time to show its symptoms while being aggressively
virulent, as the host continues to unknowingly spread in its environment. During
COVID-19, we all collectively became familiar with the concept of r-naught that
mathematicaly describes how contagious a disease is. I sat around feeling as if I
were infected with something as my mind raced. Can an idea virus exist? Is it
possible to read the perfect combination of thoughts and words that essentially
causes the human mind to experience a denial-of-service attack? I imagine it
would work in a way that spirals the mind into a sort of event horizon that you
can't escape from. What's on the other side?

To me, what's more interesting, is whether the order of these specific words matters, or even the
specificity of these words. In other words, does the language matter at all?
Is a general concept of something enough to cause a full body shutdown in this
scenario? If the combination of certain concepts is key, then that makes me
think that as long as something can be translated into thought, then even
numbers are enough to deliver this viral message.
